      <h2>Fangames & Mods</h2>
      <div class="textalignleft">
      <h3>Fangames</h3>
      <p>There aren't a whole lot of fangames out there (yet), but it's a better time than ever to start collecting the ones we DO have!</p>
        <p><a href="https://pathodate.itch.io/pathologic-visual-novel" class="a">Pathologic Dating Simulator</a> - A currently in development visual novel/dating sim adaptation of Pathologic. As of writing, the project is currently just a demo. The English version is up to Day 3 while the Russian version is on Day 4. Both languages include versions playable on Windows and Android systems.</p>
        <p><a href="https://rzzl-dzzl.itch.io/nokialogic" class="a">Nokialogic</a> - A short, simple minigame version of the original Haruspex route, designed to look like an old Nokia phone game.</p>
        <br>
      <h3>Mod Spotlight</h3>
      <p>Here are some mods that <em>I personally</em> think are worth checking out for the Pathologic games. If you would like some resources on modifying the game yourself, click <a href="modding.html">here.</a></p>
        <h4>Pathologic (2005)</h4>
        <p><a href="https://www.moddb.com/games/pathologic/addons/widescreen-support-addon-for-pathologic" class="a">Widescreen support addon for Pathologic</a> - Enables widescreen support for the original Pathologic as well as addings a few updated HD textures. You're better off just playing Classic HD, but if you wanna play the original release, then this is the mod for you!</p>

        <h4>Pathologic Classic HD</h4>
        <p><a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/pathologic-relapse" class="a">Pathologic: Relapse</a> - An overhaul mod that spruces the game up a bit. They include updated textures and sounds, increased walking speed (matched with in-game time), and some slightly edited in-game text. I don't plan on frequently listing mods, but I thought this was kind of neat. This might potentially be a good introduction to new fans who want to play Pathologic Classic HD but are turned off by certain oft-criticised aspects of the game.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/pathologicclassichd/mods/7" class="a">Neon Twyre</a> - The twyre is EXTREMELY hard to see when you're wandering through the fields! This is especially so for Classic HD, where you don't even get as much as a sound effect indicating that you're standing near them. This mod colors the twyre in neon so that they're more easily spotted. There's also a neon twyre mod for Pathologic 2 out there!</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/pathologicclassichd/mods/6" class="a">1080p Remastered HUD</a> - This mod resizes the HUD in Classic HD to look better with 1080p monitors. In the vanilla game, the HUD is super tiny and hard to see, so this mod is a nice improvement.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/pathologicclassichd/mods/11" class="a">Pathologic Classic HD x2</a> - A mod that upscales alot of the textures that were not touched in the base remaster so they are a bit more HD.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/pathologicclassichd/mods/14" class="a">Better Map</a> - This very slightly edits the map by adding in any unmarked fences. Also has an alternative that marks what shops are where!</p>
        <p><a href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/422233" class="a">Self-explanatory HUD Icons</a> - Makes the game mechanics a bit more obvious for new players by adding text under the HUD steppe glyphs explaining what they mean. Because yes, they aren't random!</p>
        <p><a href="https://rosodudemods.wordpress.com/pathologic-classic-reputation-survival-and-disease-overhaul-v1-00-beta/">Reputation, Survival, and Disease Overhaul</a> - Are you one of the chosen few who finds Pathologic Classic HD to be super easy (i.e. exploitable) and relaxing? If you're seeking a bit more challenge Ã  la what Pathologic 2 offers, this is the mod for you! Many of the easily exploitable strategies/mechanics have been made less viable while unintuitive and ignorable mechanics (i.e. anything involving immunity) have been tweaked to give the player incentive to use them. The game speed is also increased; that includes your walk speed, animations, and the in-game clock.</p>
        <p><a href="https://mega.nz/file/XlVWwKCD#c817WaMdEmxhkbvNYXPIjXtA1xhK7WEsMiJFQZ5Ka9Q" class="a">Classic HD Russian Redub</a> - Replaces all voice lines with all the original Russian-language audio, including matching facial animations. Made by me!</p>
        <p><a href="https://mega.nz/file/ftlxgbSQ#7Y6LX0YRLJHUMLlNrBAw2Blh-kOW0BKl5ir2JM-MnTY" class="a">Classic HD 2005 English Redub</a> - Replaces all voice lines with all the old 2005 English-language audio, including matching facial animations and UI text. Made by me!</p>
        <p><a href="https://mega.nz/file/31V0yYLK#SoRMqdWFDEr_udbhBnbGS-TxhyCa6dLQ9oJCVYRnUx0" class="a">Classic HD English Redub</a> - Replaces all voice lines with all the English-language audio, including matching facial animations. I know this site is tailored towards English-speaking Made by me!</p>

        <h4>Pathologic 2</h4>
        <p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/pathologic2/mods/11?tab=posts" class="a">Clarity Reshade</a> - "A Reshade preset for Pathologic 2 that seeks to highlight the sharp contrast of its theatrical lighting and remove some of the haze and muddy visuals in an attempt to achieve a clearer and more visceral visual palette." It also makes the game more difficult, requiring you to actually use your lantern now in dark areas.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/pathologic2/mods/5?tab=description" class="a">Bound Again</a> - A "mini-overhaul mod" that adds some interesting new item effects and other changes that increase the difficulty of the game. Recommended for experienced players. Comes with a district randomizer mod.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/pathologic2/mods/8" class="a">Breathing Room - Space and Time</a> - "Makes all items stackable to 20 including weapons and equipment, and extends timescale so you can complete side quests and explore at your own pace. Install either effect separately or both together." This generally makes the game a lot more chill, a good choice for people wanting to see everything after their first playthrough.</p>
