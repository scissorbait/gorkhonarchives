This mod replaces the in-game voice lines and facial animations
with the Russian-language versions from the original 2005 release. 
Note: This will overwrite any other mods you have installed that
change voice lines or dialogue animations.

Currently this is only compatible with Pathologic Classic HD.
It will NOT work with the original Pathologic (2005) release.
