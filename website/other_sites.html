      <h2>Other fanblogs and fansites</h2>
      <p>There aren't a whole lot of sites I've seen dedicated to Pathologic, but whenever I do track some down I will put them here!</p>
      <p><a href="http://pathologistics.blogspot.com/" class="a">Pathologistics</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210206233656/http://pathologistics.blogspot.com/">[archive]</a> - A neat little blog where two guys talk about their experiences playing the original 2005 release of Pathologic. I haven't read through every post (yet) but they're written in a very fun style. They only talk about the Bachelor and Haruspex routes, but apparently there used to be a separate blog for the Changeling (or Devotress) route that is now defunct. If anyone has an archive of that, then please let me know!</p>
      <p><a href="https://pathologic-the-musical.tumblr.com/" class="a">Pathologic the Musical</a> - A blog dedicated to a musical version of Pathologic that one of my friends have been working on. The songs they have written for it are great, go give their work a peek :^)</p>
      <p><a href="https://snapshotsfromgorkhon.tumblr.com/" class="a">Snapshots From Gorkhon</a> - "a collection of screenshots from pathologic classic HD and pathologic 2."</p>
      <p><a href="https://sandplague.tumblr.com" class="a">Клара & the boyz</a> - A sort of visual 'archive' of Pathologic related content. This site owes a lot to this blog for having so many high resolution images :'^)</p>
      <p><a href="https://thethanatica.neocities.org/pathocover.html" class="a">Who Are You?</a> - A neat artistic visualization of the Pathologic character select screen!</p>
      <p><a href="https://artemyburakh.neocities.org/techdemonav.html" class="a">Patho Classic Cutting Room Floor</a> - A text-based site that has a lot of interesting info laid out that was datamined from different versions of the original Pathologic.</p>
