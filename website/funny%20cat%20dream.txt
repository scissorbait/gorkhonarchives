had an awesome dream where i was in my room and there were about 3 cats that would just come out of my closet sometimes. there was a white cat that was really sweet and cute and cuddly. i didn't always get to be too close to it but it would like.. snuggle up on the beanbag or something. there was a white kitten that would just squeak and jump and try to grab at me and hang off of me. silly little thing. and there was a black cat who was sort of mean and would leave the room really quickly if it got bored/annoyed. most of the time getting near it, it would try and hurt me.
