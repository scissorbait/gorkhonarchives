      <h2>Extra resources</h2>
      <div class="textalignleft">
        <p>A lot of fans have compiled a bunch of different resources relating to Pathologic and its fandom. These are mainly collected from posts I've seen on social media as well as links I've seen passed around on Discord servers.</p>
        <p><a href="https://pathologic.fandom.com/wiki/Pathologic_Wiki" class="a">Official Pathologic Wiki</a> - One of the best resources on the web for information about the Pathologic games. Much of what I don't cover here is covered over on the wiki, so if you didn't already know about it, go check it out!</p>
        <p><a href="https://pathologic.fandom.com/wiki/Easter_eggs_and_references" class="a">Pathologic Easter eggs and references</a> - One of a few wiki pages that you kinda have to look for to find. An organized list of some neat little easter eggs you can find in Pathologic, as well as references to Pathologic in other media!</p>
        <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gPJLFTbfzxtU3wA-PBP5za8Cpafch52DhY5ZNqtcZ2Q/edit" class="a">Pathologic User Stories</a> - User stories written by the developers of Pathologic 2.

        <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/118b9OX6PKCJgt3gpp1dYcn9eoGL7ZiOVcyMIdWu8e-I/edit#gid=0" class="a">Classic HD Emotion Animations Chart</a> - "the files of Pathologic Classic HD handle character expressions by assigning each NPC four or five animation scripts, which are stored under the name of the corresponding emotion. all characters’ files have a “Neutral” state, and while there’s a lot of overlap for emotions like “Smile” and “Fear”, many characters have unique ones!" This doc also has a few extra neat details in separate spreadsheets. (credit to rathologic on tumblr)</p>
        <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160104233047/http://ice-pick.com/translate/glossary.html" class="a">Pathologic Translation Project (TPT) Glossary</a> - A glossary of names, terms, and other words from the first Pathologic all sorted in a table. It includes the original Russian, accepted/unaccepted translations, and a brief description of the term's meaning/significance. This was actually a semi-official project, given the participation of Aleksey Luchin (The LxR) in the forum section dedicated to it.</p>
        <p><a href="https://pathologicdialogue.github.io/" class="a">Pathologic Dialogue Trees</a> - Here you can find every single line of dialogue in both Pathologic Classic HD and Pathologic 2 neatly organized in a branching format (just like in the game!)
