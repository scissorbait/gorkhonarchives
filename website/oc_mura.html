            <p><b>Interests:</b> Tailoring clothes, singing</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Voice:</b> Soft and casual. A bit breathy, inhales a bit before most lines and speaks through sighs. Almost like he’s out of breath or something.</p>
            <p><b>Personality:</b> Very laid-back and relaxed, albeit somewhat lethargic. They're very friendly, and tend to overlook any rude comments or sarcastic remarks and respond to things very genuinely. Sometimes they have a hard time following long explanations or complex terminology, and frequently speak in vague and symbolic language. They tend to relate most situations back to their work as a tailor. Optimistic almost to a fault..</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>General backstory:</b></p>
            <p>Mura had been living in the Town for three years by the time Artemy arrived. They used to live in a larger town and worked producing clothes in the factory, since that was the local industry. He had caught wind of the opportunistic ventures of the Stamatin brothers in town-on-gorkhon, and moved there to have a better, less industrial environment to tailor clothes in. they quickly made friends with the stamatins, who helped them find work and encouraged their original creations.</p>
            <p>He had an alright reputation at first, but as he grew closer to Andrey and Grief, people became a bit more wary of them. However, it was more of a slight hesitation rather than outright isolation. Their connections to the Utopians kept them in the Town’s good graces. Once the second outbreak hit, they abandoned their shop and sought out help from Bad Grief to continue their work in private. His main concern was being locked up by Saburovs for having shady connections and being arrested by association. Grief was able to clear him a room where another shady merchant was located, and Mura was able to continue their business, albeit with generally less reputable customers coming through.</p>
            <p>The children like Mura because he always has interesting stories to tell and loves to hear their own stories as well. He gets along fairly well with the Soul-and-a-Halves.</p>

      <h2>Plot Significance</h2>
      <div class="pl beeg">
        <ul>
          <li>Artemy can meet Mura early on in the clothes shop in the Gut. Otherwise, he's suggested to go visit them on Day 3 by the Bachelor, who has already met them. They apparently have the lowest prices in town when it comes to clothes.</li>
          <li>On Day 2, if Artemy has met Mura, they will mention having a lot of "spare things I don't need" and will trade items other than clothes. If Artemy does not meet them before Day 3, he begins trading things other than clothes on Day 4 when he moves to the Shady Shop. He is one room away from the main shopkeeper there.</li>
          <li>Any day the Warehouses are infected, there is a 30% chance Mura won't be in the shop and instead wandering aimlessly around the area. If Artemy speaks to them, he will scold them and send them back to their shop. If he doesn't send them back, their immunity meter will be lower than usual due to their exposure to the plague miasma.</li>
          <li>Artemy can visit Mura at night to share his findings with them. Mura will attempt to give their input on his next move when asked, but their advice is rarely fruitful and usually will just end up wasting Artemy's time if he follows it. On Day 6, Artemy can confront him about it, and Mura will say he is "more of a listener than a helper."</li>
          <li>If Peter gets infected, Mura can be found inside his home sitting on a wooden chair, their idle animation showing them nodding off. They can't be spoken to normally, but will still be open to trade.</li>
          <li>If Kostya dies, Mura will confront Artemy about it at some point during the day, mentioning that his trust in Artemy was broken and how lost he feels. During the midnight diceroll, Mura will be marked as dead.</li>
          <li>On the day several members of the Kin are asking Artemy for his help outside the lair, Mura will be standing by the Wonder Bull. Mura will ask him to "do a special treatment" for him someday when Artemy starts to better understand the lines. Artemy will say that he already went to medical school, and that it shouldn't be too out of his realm of expertise. Mura will agree but still insists that they will bring it up again when the time is right.</li>
          <li>Mura replaces the man who plays Victoria's Song on the piano in the abandoned house. They claim to love the song, but also admit that they don't really know how to play piano.</li>
          <li>By Days 7 and 9, Mura will be somewhere around the Haruspex's Lair (usually near the Wonder Bull) and will offer to repair Artemy's clothes if he has the right materials.</li>
          <li>On Day 8, Mura will be in the Cathedral sitting with Bad Grief. Artemy can ask them about what Grief was talking about and he will say that Aglaya told him the same thing, "but unlike Grief, it doesn't bother me." Mura will also mention being worried about getting arrested, and Artemy will reassure them that they'll be fine.</li>
          <li>On Day 12 of the Diurnal ending, Mura will be sitting on the swingset by the Cathedral. They will ask Artemy if he's going to stay in town, because they would miss him if he left. They also mention the “special treatment” again.</li>
          <li>On Day 12 of the Nocturnal ending, Mura will be sitting in front of Grief’s hideout with his arms wrapped around his knees and head down. Mura will ask where everyone is and why the plague didn’t take them already. Artemy can assure them that they’ll be okay or tell them about the future. Mura will end the conversation with silence.</li>

      <h2>Trivia</h2>
      <div class="pl beeg">
        <ul>
          <li>Mura uses a homemade hair custard made from boiled river water, White Whip gel, and wax. Their poor health makes it hard for them to collect the White Whip themselves, so they usually get it from Andrey. They're surprised to find out that White Whip has an actual use in tinctures.</li>
          <li>Mura assists all the different healers and tends to give all of them special treatment. They are generally up-to-date on what each healer may be doing, so they can give additional insight on why each healer may be doing this or that. They have a particular fondness for Artemy and can be found more often around places he’s likely to be around.</li>
          <li>In any other route where Kostya dies, Mura won’t be marked dead, but will be missing from the game going forward. On Day 12, he will be sitting outside Artemy’s lair with his face hidden in his arms. His only dialogue will be “Don’t talk to me. You killed my friend.”</li>
          <li>Mura's weapons of choice are their abnormally sharp, wooden knitting needles, which function like slightly weaker knives. They tend to injure themselves with their needles alot, so their hands are covered in bandages most of the time.</li>
          <li>Artemy can make a comment about Mura's clothing choice despite being a tailor, to which Mura replies that they only wear clothes they feel comfortable in, not that they'd necessarily look good in.</li>
          <li>Mura doesn't take very good care of himself because of how absorbed he can get in his work. They are constantly fatigued and get frequent headaches, and they sell their food/water because he knows he probably won't use it himself anyway.</li>
          <li>Mura has two reflections that sit on the rock structures in the Steppe. They’re too high up to be interacted with in normal gameplay.</li>
          <li>Mura actually really likes Rubin. It's Rubin that doesn't like them.</li>
        </ul>
